# CZ1115-Mini-Project
Mini Project for CZ1115 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

There are 3 segments to the repository

### Geospatial Analysis of Sales of Product
We analyse how the sales of products varies between locations

### Relationship between Product Categories and Customer Reviews
We analyse which categories are more positively reviewed by customers

### Using Reviews to Predict Score
We attempt to train a machine learning model to predict the score of a review based on the text within the review. There is also an interactive `tkinter` widget to interact with the pretrained model. Run `GUI.py` to play with it.
